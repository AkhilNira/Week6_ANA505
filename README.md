# Week6_ANA505
Week 6 activity for ANA505

The 3 scripts provided tried to predict what species did the data belong to.
In each of the scripts, the Petal length and Petal Width helped define what species the flower lies.

**C50 Algorithm:**
Here the dataset was divided into 2 parts (training and testing). The Training dataset was used to create a model and the Testing data set was used to test out if the model predicted correctly or not.
This algorithm showed 95.556% accuracy

**K Means Algorithm**
This being an unsupervised algorithm, it tried to place the data in distinct clusters. This script helped place each dataset in 3 different clusters that corresponded to the number of species in question.
This algorithm's accuracy was 88.667%

**SVM Algorithm**
This script uses the length and width as the two support vectors to define a classification hyperplaned for the different datasets.
This model's accuracy is the highest at 97.333%
